This program demonstrates multi-threading to simulate a simplified lamp manufacturing system. The following is needed to construct a lamp: 4 screws, one base, one stand, three sockets, and three light bulbs.
The following producers are available: Screw, Base, Stand, Socket, LightBulb; Each producer has an array to store it produced items, and a producer produces as many items as possible to keep the array full. The production speed for each producer is different. The Screw producer produces 4 screws each time; Base two bases each time, Stand 4 stands each time, Socket 7 sockets each time, LightBulb 4 each time.
Two consumers consume all items independently in order to construct a lamp. The consumer stops constructing a lamp if the needed materials is not available and continue to construct when the supply allows to construct a lamp.
A producer can only start if there is space to store te produced items, and a consumer can only start if there is enough material present to asscemble a lamp.
